# Geekbench 6

This workload packages the Geekbench 6.7.0 Linux/RISC-V Preview binaries into a
Linux initramfs workload.

Preview builds require an upload and reject the Pro-only offline/export
switches. The default image keeps that normal upload flow while enabling the
same offline runtime takeover as the Geekbench 5 workload: the build rewrites
the embedded HTTPS endpoint without changing ELF offsets, and the preload
library replaces IPv4/IPv6 sockets with an in-process local transport. The
kernel source and networking configuration are unchanged and no listener is
required.

Build the all-in-one NEMU firmware image:

```shell
make linux/geekbench6
```

The resulting firmware is written to `build/linux-workloads/geekbench6/` as
`fw_payload.bin`, with the unpacked initramfs in `rootfs.cpio` and generated
device trees in `dt/`.

This workload uses `dts/xiangshan-fpga-noAIA.dts.in` as its built-in default
device tree so the large Geekbench initramfs stays inside Linux-visible memory.

The automated boot path runs `./geekbench_riscv64 --cpu --iterations 1` so the
simulator validation can reach a good trap in reasonable time. The default DTB
describes one hart, so the Preview CPU run is single-core in this workload.

Set `GEEKBENCH_ARGS='...'` at build time to change the Geekbench CLI. The
default is `--cpu --iterations 1`:

```shell
GEEKBENCH_ARGS='--sysinfo' make linux/geekbench6
```

The preload library and in-process transport capture the normal upload. They
extract the calculated `score` and `multicore_score` values from the upload
document and print them without contacting the Browser. The complete captured
upload request is printed before the score summary. The capture buffer grows
with each request and honors that request's own `Content-Length`; chunked or
close-delimited uploads are also captured in full. After a complete scored
upload is printed and parsed, the preload shim finishes the Preview process so
it cannot wait for a real Browser response. The boot script calls `nemu-trap 0`
after the Geekbench process returns. The generated inittab also appends `nemu-trap -1` after
`/geekbench/run.sh` as a fallback for cases where the run script exits before
issuing its own trap.

By default, no trap is emitted before the workload starts. Build with
`PROFILING=1` to emit `nemu-trap 256` and `nemu-trap 257` from inittab before
the benchmark starts:

```shell
PROFILING=1 make linux/geekbench6
```

If you have a Pro-capable Geekbench binary, you can add `--single-core` or
`--multi-core` in `GEEKBENCH_ARGS`. The Preview binaries in this repo reject
both switches as Pro-only.

The tarball also includes `geekbench_rv64gcv`; it is installed in the image for
manual use, while the automatic boot path runs the scalar `geekbench_riscv64`
binary for broader simulator compatibility.

The Geekbench Preview binary exposes only the full CPU benchmark and sysinfo
commands. Individual workload switches are present in the binary but require
Geekbench Pro, so this workload builds the runnable CPU benchmark image.

The workload always enables the takeover; there is no network-enabled mode in
the generated image.
